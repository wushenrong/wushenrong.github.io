  This is where I put writings about technology, development tools, programming experience and commentary on open
  source. Use the year links below to find older posts.

<ul class="post-years">
  {%- for year in site.data.years -%}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ year | prepend: '/' | relative_url }}">{{ year }}</a>
    </li>
  {%- endfor -%}
</ul>
